## How to run?

Our application is easy to run. 

To run the ***Front-End***:

Go to the cmd and type ```npm install``` and then ```npm start```.
Or you can run through docker by typing ```docker run -p 3000:8080 <image-name>```.

To run the ***Back-End***:

All of our microservices are deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and it directly calls the RDS instance. 
So running the front-end is enough.

However one can try to run locally too. Just follow the instruction of the ```.env``` file and then build the docker image for every microservices. 

Thanks,

Boockeroo Team
